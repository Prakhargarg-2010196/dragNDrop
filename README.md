# dragNDrop
Assignment for internship
The assignment can be run by opening the index.html file live on any suitable text editor.

I have created the following functionality right now 
- [x] we can currently put static elements in the list and then drag and drop from one list to another 
- [x] Highlight when dragging the element and removal of highlight when the element is being dropped.
- [x] A reset button to get back to the original list of items
- [x] Its almost responsive but ui can be improved. 

# Following functionality is to be covered
- [ ] To take input from user data for the list of data to be drag and dropped

NOTE: Right now i have statically placed an image and some text nodes but in future dynamicity can be added.
